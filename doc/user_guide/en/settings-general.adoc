[[FIG_CONFIG_STATION]]

Select the *General* tab on the *Settings* window.  Under *Station
Details* enter your callsign, grid locator (preferably the 6-character
locator) and IARU Region number. (Region 1 is Europe, Africa, the
Middle East, and Northern Asia; Region 2 the Americas; and Region 3
Southern Asia and the Pacific.) Meanings of remaining options on the
*General* tab should be mostly self-explanatory after you have made
some QSOs using _WSJT-X_. You can return to set these options to your
preferences later.

NOTE: If you are using a callsign with an add-on prefix or suffix, or
wish to work a station using such a call, be sure to read the section
<<COMP-CALL,Nonstandard Callsigns>>.

NOTE: Checking *Enable VHF/UHF/Microwave features* disables the
wideband multi-decode capability of JT65.  In most circumstances you
should turn this feature off when operating at HF.
