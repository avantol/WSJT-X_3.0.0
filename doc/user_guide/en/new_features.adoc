=== New in Version 3.0

_WSJT-X 3.0_ incorporates all developments successfully tested up to
_WSJT-X Improved_ 2.8.0 and a number of new items. The list below
summarizes important new features. For more details you should
carefully read the sections in this guide linked in the following notes,
especially if you have not previously used _WSJT-X Improved_.

- *Band Buttons* can be enabled and displayed from the *View*
menu. Two sets of buttons are available: an HF-oriented set for 160 m
through 70 cm bands, and a VHF-and-up set for 8 m through 24 GHz. See
the <<BAND_BUTTONS,Band Buttons>> section for more details.

- *FT8 Decoding* includes an option for <<DECODE_MENU,parallel
processing>> with up to a dozen concurrent threads, yielding improved
performance.

- *Filters* can be used to suppress display of certain categories of
decodes. For example, you can hide, ignore, or highlight stations
worked before on the current band, or worked today or
yesterday. Categories are defined on the *File | Settings | Filters*
<<FILTERS,tab>>, and options to turn categories on or off are found on
the <<FILTERS_MENU,*Filters*>> menu.
 
- *Wait and Reply*, *Wait and Call*, and *Wait and Pounce* are options
to help you make QSOs under difficult propagation conditions while
minimizing useless transmissions. See <<WAIT_FEATURES,Wait Features>>
for details.

- *Audible Alerts* can play an audio sound to alert you to reception of
a message with specified content. Activating this feature requires
access to at least two audio output devices. See <<ALERTS,Audible Alerts>>
for details.

- *Auto-Sequencing*, *Filters*, *Reply-to-CQ*, and *Wait* features are
now available for all _WSJT-X_ QSO modes: the 72-bit modes JT4, JT9,
and JT65, as well as the 77-bit modes FST4, FT4, FT8, MSK144, and
Q65. 

- *Full Duplex Mode* allows _WSJT-X_ to transmit and receive at the
same time. This feature can be useful for satellite operation, where
the audio source is normally set to the transponder downlink, and for
monitoring your own transmitted signal by using a webSDR as the audio
input source. 

- *Transceiver Control Interface (TCI)*, a software layer allowing control,
data transfer, and synchronization between a wide variety of hardware
devices and software applications, is supported by _WSJT-X_ for
both rig control and audio input/output.

- *SuperHound* operators can activate *Wait and Call* for a *SuperFox*
callsign, even if SuperFox has not yet been decoded. However, blind
calling of SuperFox is prevented. Fox operators receive a warning
message if another Fox appears to be on the same frequency, and
_WSJT-X_ will prevent inadvertent Fox transmissions from falling
within a conventional WSPR sub-band.

- *Transmitted Power and SWR* can be displayed (as reported by the
radio) in a Status Bar label. Transmission can be stopped
automatically if SWR exceeds 2.5 -- for example, if you accidentally
select the wrong antenna. These features work with most modern radios
controlled via _Hamlib_ or _FLRig_.

- *Right-click of Tune Button* can be used to initiate ATU tuning in
some rig models. This feature requires the radio to be equipped with
an internal ATU and controlled via _Hamlib_.

- *Band Hopping* checkboxes for FT8, FT4 and MSK144 can activate
sequential reception intervals on the main sub-bands, or on up to eight 
specified dial frequencies.  The latter can be useful for contests and
other situations with frequencies of special interest.

- *Saved Audio Files* can be scheduled for automatic deletion after 30
days. This feature can be used to keep disk usage for saved files
within reasonable limits, while still preserving important information
that might prove useful for later analysis. 
 
- *CALL3.TXT files* for either terrestrial or EME use can be
downloaded by clicking a button on the *File | Settings | Colors*
tab.

- *New EME Features* include easier ways to select dial frequencies
within an EME sub-band and to offset your Tx frequency by an integer
number of MHz from the Rx frequency, to accommodate different regulatory
frequency allocations. New buttons are provided for quick access to
Echo mode and six popular Q65 sub-modes. For experimental purposes,
the sub-modes 15A, 15B and 15C can be decoded with EME delay.
 
- *QSO Logging* supports the ADIF field type for satellite QSOs, and
*the Log automatically* option is available when not in contest
mode. New checkboxes on the *File | Settings | Reporting* tab provide
new support for certain contests.

- *OpenSSL* is now installed automatically with _WSJT-X_. Manual
intervention is necessary only if another, incompatible OpenSSL
version is already installed on the computer.

- *High Resolution Monitors* are supported with better scaling of
fonts and widget sizes.
