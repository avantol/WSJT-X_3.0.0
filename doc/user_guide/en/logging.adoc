Information on completed QSOs is saved to files in comma-separated
text format (`wsjtx.log`) and ADIF format (`wsjtx_log.adi`). Initiate
logging by clicking the *Log QSO* button, or by having checked *Prompt
me to log QSO* on the *File | Settings | Reporting* tab. Several other
options are available: for example, check *Special operating activity
to comments* to add information about the special activity to the
logged *Comments* field.

Most fields in the *Log QSO* window will be pre-filled with known
information about the QSO, and you can manually enter additional
information. Start date and time are determined when sent the *Tx 2*
or *Tx 3* message, backed up by one or two sequence lengths,
respectively.  (Note that the actual start time may have been earlier
if repeats of early transmissions were required.) End date and time
are set when the *Log QSO* screen is invoked. Choosing "Satellite" for
*Prop Mode* activates the *Satellite* field so you can identify the
particular satellite.
