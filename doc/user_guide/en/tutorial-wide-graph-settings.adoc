The WSJT-X Wide Graph window displays the frequency spectrum of
received audio. Usually, the upper portion shows a waterfall plot of
the frequency spectrum (a spectrogram) and a line plot of the current
or average spectrum. Controls at the bottom of the window are used to
set up the displayed audio frequency range, color palette, and scaling
of the spectrum displays.  A control *Spec nn%* at the bottom right
lets you adjust the vertical fraction of the window occupied by the
spectrum line plot.  It is important to set appropriate lower and
upper audio frequency limits for the Wide Graph because these limits
define the FT8 decoder's search window. For this tutorial, the limits
will be set to cover 100-3300 Hz:

- Set *Start* = 100 Hz.

- Set *Bins/Pixel* = 5. Smaller or larger values make the Wide Graph
cover a smaller/larger frequency range.

- Use the mouse to grab the left or right edge of the *Wide Graph*,
and adjust its width so that the upper frequency limit is about 3300
Hz.

- Set *N Avg* = 2. This number determines how many spectra are
averaged to produce each line in the spectrogram.  Smaller values make
the spectrogram scroll and update more frequently, resulting in
signals being more spread out in the vertical (time) direction. Larger
values make it easier to detect very weak signals.

The *Palette* setting controls the color scheme used for the spectrogram: 

- Set *Palette* = Fldigi 

When *Flatten* is checked, _WSJT-X_ attempts to correct for slope or
curvature in the receiver's passband shape.

- *Flatten* = checked 

The line plot can be set to display the current (un-averaged) spectrum or the cumulative (averaged)
spectrum:

- Select *Cumulative* for data display
- Set the *Gain* and *Zero* sliders for the waterfall and spectrum to near midscale

The *Spec nn%* setting determines what fraction of the vertical extent of the Wide Graph will
be used for the line plot of the spectrum. Setting *Spec* to 0 will eliminate the line plot and
a setting of 100 will eliminate the spectrogram and show only the line plot:

- Set *Spec* = 50%
