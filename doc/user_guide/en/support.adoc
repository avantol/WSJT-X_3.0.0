=== Help with Setup

The best source of help in setting up your station or configuring
_WSJT-X_ will be one of these email lists: {wsjt-devel},
{wsjtx_group}, {wsjt_group}, or {wsjt-x-improved-community}. The
chances are good that someone with similar interests and equipment has
already solved your problem and will be happy to help.  To post
messages in any of these forums you will need to join the group.

=== Bug Reports

One of your responsibilities as a _WSJT-X_ user is to help the
volunteer programmers to make the program better.  Bugs may be
reported to one of the email lists mentioned above. Again, you will
need to subscribe to the list.

To be useful, bug reports should include at least the following
information:

- Program version
- Operating system
- Concise description of the problem
- Exact sequence of steps required to reproduce the problem

=== Feature Requests

Suggestions from users often result in new program features.  Good
ideas are always welcome: if there's a feature you would like to see
in _WSJT-X_, spell it out in as much detail as seems useful and send
it to us at one of the email addresses given a few lines above.  Be
sure to explain why you think the feature is desirable, and what sort
of other users might find it so.
