If *Show distance/azimuth with grid* is checked, decoded messages
including the transmitting station's locator will be displayed with
the calculated distance and great-circle azimuth from your
location.

Check *Align DXCC / distance / azimuth* to keep DXCC names or
principal prefixes as well as distance and azimuth in an aligned table
form. Two spin boxes allow further configuration of your preferred
layout: the first sets the number of spaces between the decoded
message and the DXCC name; the second sets the number of spaces
between the DXCC and the distance/azimuth field.

The following screen shot shows an example *Band Activity* pane with
*Show distance in messages with grid*, *Show azimuth in messages with
grid* and *Align DXCC / distance / azimuth* enabled.

US States can be optionally appended to the decoded messages.  Check
*Map Grid locator to U.S. State* to do this for CQ calls only, or
*Show U.S. States in messages with grid* to include all messages
containing a grid locator. Where a grid locator's region overlaps more
than one State, all possibilities are presented.
