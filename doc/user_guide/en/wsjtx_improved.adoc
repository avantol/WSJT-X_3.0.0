_WSJT-X Improved_ is available with three different Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). For technical reasons, each version uses a
different installer. The default download has the standard _WSJT-X_
GUI. The second is more compact (= alternative layout, "AL"),and the
third is optimized for wide screens. The latter two provide larger
Band Activity windows, so you can see more decodes without scrolling
back. 

Version AL (alternative layout) looks like this:

The wide screen version looks like this:

To have more than one version available for use, install them in
separate directories such as `C:\WSJT\wsjtx_improved`,
`C:\WSJT\wsjtx_improved_AL`, `C:\WSJT\wsjtx_improved_widesreen`, and
then create starter hyperlinks on your desktop for the `wsjtx.exe`
files in their respective `\bin` subdirectories.  Then you can start each
version as desired, for comparison. The `WSJT-X.ini` file with your
settings will be recognized and used automatically.

In Windows, the starter hyperlinks can be located in a suitably named
desktop batch file with the following example text:

 c:\WSJT\wsjtx_improved\bin
 start wsjtx 

The file must have filename extension `.bat`.  Double clicking on the
batch file will start _WSJT-X_ from the specified directory.

You can run several program instances at the same time using the
"rig-name" method, as described <<FAQ,here>>. A suitable batch file
would be something like this:

 c:\WSJT\wsjtx_improved_AL\bin
 start  wsjtx --rig-name=NAME_XYZ

In such cases _WSJT-X_ creates individual .ini files for each instance so
they can operate independently.
