.Decode Highlighting

* _WSJT-X_ uses colors to highlight decoded CQ messages of particular
  interest.  Check the box *Show DXCC, grid, and worked-before status*
  on the *File |Settings | General* tab, and any boxes of interest to you on
  the *Colors* tab.  You can drag any line up or down to raise or
  lower its logical priority.  Right-click any line to set a new
  foreground or background color.  Foreground and background colors
  are applied separately, and careful choices of foreground,
  background, and priority can provide two indications of
  worked-before status.

* Press the *Reset Highlighting* button to reset all of the color
  settings to default values.

* Check *Highlight by Mode* if you wish worked-before status to be per
  <<INTRO,mode>>.

* Check *Only grid Fields sought* if you are only interested in the
  leading two character grid locator Fields rather than the four
  character grid locator Squares.

* Check *Include extra WAE entities* if you are interested in the
  extra entities defined for DARC WAE and CQ Marathon awards.

* Worked-before status is determined from file `wsjtx_log.adi` in your
log directory. You can replace ADIF log file with one exported from
your station logging application. Clicking *Rescan ADIF Log* will
rebuild the _WSJT-X_ worked-before index from the current ADIF log
file.

.Logbook of The World User Validation

Stations who are known to have uploaded their logs to the ARRL LoTW
QSL matching service can be highlighted. The data used to determine
this is available online.

* *Fetch Now* will download a fresh dataset from the *Users CSV file
   URL*. The LoTW team normally update this data weekly.

* Adjust *Age of last upload less than* to set the period within
  which a station must have uploaded their log to LoTW to trigger
  highlighting.

.Alternative Highlighting

Some users find an alternative color scheme with pastel-like colors
easier on the eyes and more suitable for the dark style. You can
select either the original _WSJT-X_ or the alternative style.  With
the alternative style, stations uploading their logbook to LoTW will
have black foreground color, others red. Stations worked-before are
displayed with grey background.

It is still possible for you to customize the color scheme according
to your own preferences. In addition, you can highlight individual
callsigns or grids according to your specifications.  Callsigns and/or
grids can be highlighted with orange or blue background
color. Callsigns/grids must be separated by commas and can be mixed
(e.g. "K1JT, DG2YCB, JO33, JN58,"). You must include a comma after
each callsign or grid, and also at the end of the line.
